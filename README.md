# Autolegalo

This is Autolegalo, automation scripts for my server network.

Originally, this was a set of scripts to automate creation and management of a new public server - archipelago.water.gkhs.net - but it's expanded to manage and automate my home media centre (millpond) and some admin tasks for another server - cenote - to keep things aligned.

It's also a bit of an experiment in working in public, since this repository is open despite containing detailed information on how the servers are set up.

Some of these roles could probably be spun out as their own projects, but I'm not really willing to take on maintainance, and since part of the reason some of them exist is because people have rolled their own solutions and uploaded them without genericising them a bit, I'm unwilling to make the situation actively worse by doing the same. Feel free to use these as a basis for scratching your own itch.

I intend to write a Theory of Operation for this at some point, but generally roles are named {hostname}-{job} for stuff for specific machines, and water-gkhs-{job} for stuff that spans the host group.
